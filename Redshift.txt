data--database

1)redshift cluster--100
2)create a datbase
3)create a table
4)load the data to that table


redshift spectrum
1)redshift cluster--50
2)create a datbase
3)load the data from s3 bucket
NOTE: loading the data into datbase,
you are referring the s3 data in the redshift database

what is the advantage of redshift spectrum?
when to chose which one?

1)Architecure of redhist?
2)different ways of loading data to redshift
3)what is redshift spectrum?
4)what is the advantage of redshift spectrum?
5)when to chose which one?
when there is no criticalty of the data in redshift or reporting like power bi
used from redshift then only i will go for redshift spectrum
or else i will load the data into redshift database.

Redshift spectrum--having the data in s3 and pointing in redshift database
